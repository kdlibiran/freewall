# FreeWall: Anonymous Social Media Application #

FreeWall is a personal project I developed, inspired by the concept of Freedom Wall accounts on various social media platforms. It offers users the ability to express themselves anonymously through different walls, akin to subreddits, where they can post text content freely.

## Key Features: ##

* Anonymous Posting: Users can write and share text content anonymously, fostering open expression without the need for account registration.
Customizable Walls: FreeWall allows users to create and customize their own walls, providing a platform for diverse topics and interests.
Follow System: Rather than joining specific walls, users can simply follow walls of interest, enabling seamless exploration of content across various themes.

## Technologies Utilized: ##

* Frontend Development: Leveraged Tailwind CSS and Next.js (React) to ensure a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

* Backend Infrastructure: Utilized Next.js (Node.js) and Supabase for backend development, enabling secure data management and seamless integration with the frontend.

* Deployment: Deployed on Vercel for reliable hosting and optimal performance, ensuring accessibility for users.

FreeWall showcases my proficiency in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and project management, highlighting my ability to conceptualize and execute innovative solutions that cater to diverse user needs while prioritizing anonymity and user experience.
